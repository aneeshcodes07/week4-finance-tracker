# Personal Finance Tracker – Week 4 Project

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Personal Finance Tracker** is a Python-based console application developed as part of **Week 4: File Handling & Final Project**.  
This project helps users manage personal expenses by recording, categorizing, saving data to files, and generating useful reports.

The application combines concepts learned across **Weeks 1–4**, including Python fundamentals, functions, object-oriented programming, file handling, and modular code organization.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand and implement file handling in Python
- Persist data using files (JSON format)
- Organize a project into multiple modules
- Handle file-related errors gracefully
- Build a real-world, menu-driven application

---

## ✨ Features
- Add new expenses with date, amount, category, and description
- View all recorded expenses
- Generate category-wise expense summaries
- Save and load data using JSON files
- Data persistence between program runs
- Modular and well-structured codebase
- User-friendly menu-driven interface

---

## 🛠️ Concepts Covered (Week 4)
- File operations (read/write)
- Working with text-based structured files (JSON)
- Context managers (`with` statement)
- Error handling for file operations
- Code organization using multiple Python modules
- Debugging and testing file-based applications
